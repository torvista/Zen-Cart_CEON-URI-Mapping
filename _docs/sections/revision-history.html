Servers currently supported for analysis are Apache, IIS with URL Rewrite and IIS with ISAPI_Rewrite.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] The setting for automatically generating and adding URIs for Tell-A-Friend pages is now set to off on new installations of Ceon URI Mapping as this functionality has been removed from Zen Cart 1.5.x. It is still fine to be used on both Zen Cart 1.3.x and Zen Cart 1.5.x but will have no useful benefit on 1.5.x, just taking up space in the database unnecessarily.</p>

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry RevisionHistoryLastEntry">[UPDATED] The version Id header lines have been updated in some of the core modified files as they were out of sync with the lines in the equivalent fresh versions of Zen Cart.

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Installation check and example rewrite rule functionality added.
			<br />Once the Config Utility has been successfully installed, and the database &amp; configuration installed or brought up to date, the user can access the installation check/example rewrite rule functionality from the config utility. This smart and useful addition to the software will analyse the store's configuration files and warn the user if there are any mistakes in the files which they need to correct, and will even provide full information about what they should do. It will also check all the core files that must be modified for Ceon URI Mapping to work optimally, and warn the user if any of the modifications are missing or out of date, again giving information on what the user should do!
			<br />A quick glance at this new admin page should help the user identify and fix any problems with the installation quickly and easily!
			<br />Finally, the check will analyse the store's filesystem and build an example rewrite rule for the store, along with instructions on how to get the rule working. Adding the rewrite rule should now just be a simple matter of copying and pasting the rule built by this new functionality!</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Compatibility with IIS ISAPI_Rewrite 3 and IIS URL Rewrite added, in part by updating the sample rewrite rules. The example rules now use the &ldquo;QSA&rdquo; flag instead of appending the query string with &ldquo;?%{QUERY_STRING}&rdquo;. The updated rules remain compatible with all Apache versions, on any platform.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Checks added throughout rewritten software to prevent any URI mappings being added that clash with an existing (current) URI mapping.
			<br />
			A setting has been added that lets the store choose whether they'd rather be notified about any such clashes, or (for products only at this time) whether they would rather the software automatically append a number to the end of the mapping to make it unique and therefore stop it from clashing with the existing URI mapping.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Checks added throughout rewritten software to prevent any duplicate historical URI mappings being created in the database.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Messages are now displayed in the message stack whenever a URI mapping is added, updated or converted to a historical URI. Gives assurance that the desired change(s) was/were made, especially since any auto-generated/entered/updated URI mapping is displayed within the respective success message.
			<br />Any newly added/updated mapping is clickable within this message, so the user can see it working straight away in a new browser tab/window.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] New settings added to allow the store to specify which &ldquo;pages related to a product&rdquo; should have their URIs auto-managed by the software.
			<br />There are four page types which can be auto-managed: &ldquo;Products Reviews&rdquo;, &ldquo;Product Review Info&rdquo;, &ldquo;Write a Review&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tell A Friend&rdquo;.
			<br />If a store doesn't use a particular page type, disabling its auto-management will mean that the URI mapping database isn't populated unnecessarily, making it smaller and therefore slightly more efficient/quicker.
			<br />The page types which are to be auto-managed can be enabled/disabled in a new section in the config utility. The URI parts which are to be appended for the auto-managed URIs are now entered in another new section in the config utility, instead of being defined in language defines, as was the case previously, making it considerably easier to specify the desired URI parts.
			<br />Also, as noted in a bugfix entry below, previous versions of the module didn't support multiple languages properly.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Functionality added to the module to &ldquo;normalise&rdquo; the effects of using a rewrite rule. Previously, with some server configurations, the use of a rewrite rule would result in the $PHP_SELF variable value having a useless value. The new code attempts to circumvent this problem and provide a meaningful value for the variable.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Ceon URI Mapping functionality implemented in product move and copy functionality for four more product types: document_general, document_product, product_free_shipping and product_music. Previously the Ceon URI mapping functionality for these product types was only available when adding or updating a product.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Sample modified core files for Zen Cart 1.3.9g and 1.3.9h added to the distribution.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Sample modified files for third party module &ldquo;Multilanguage EZ-Pages&rdquo; module added to the distribution.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Support for Ceon Model Code and automatic version checking functionality added.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Module restructured into using a class-based structure. A base class provides shared functionality. Subclasses can then be created which differ in how they run.
			<br />The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; class is designed for maximum compatibility and flexibility, while remaining as lightweight and nimble as possible.
			<br />Alternative versions can be created which are specific to certain server setups, skipping unnecessary configuration checks and/or using more efficient code to map URIs, for maximum speed.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] URI mappings now have any trailing slashes stripped. URIs can no longer end in a trailing slash. Auto-upgrade functionality will automatically remove trailing slashes for any URI existing mappings.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Excluded Files functionality removed as the new, improved Ceon URI Mapping instantiation code can determine whether or not Ceon URI Mapping should attempt to analyse and map the current URI. This means the module should be 100% compatible with all other Zen Cart modules capable of working with static URIs, without the store having to adjust anything at all!</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] An alternate URI can now be as little as one character in length. Previously it could only be two characters or greater in length. This allows redirecting of URIs directly to the home page (/).</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] The canonical tag is no longer added using an auto-loaded JavaScript file. For Zen Cart 1.3.9 it is now added by using Zen Cart's built-in canonical output functionality (overriding the code to use the Ceon URI Mapping canonical URI). For earlier versions of Zen Cart a small core file modification is now needed to the template file common/html_header.php, to bring it up to date and make it compatible with the canonical URI functionality of the module.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Extra core file override (init_sessions.php) included for Zen Cart 1.3.9 as it doesn't set the cookie path to the root of the site, which is what is required for sites that use static URIs. The override prevents the propagation of the session ID (zenid=xxxx) in the URI beyond the second page visited, when the visitor accepts cookies. The first page visited will still have the session ID at the end of all links as that is an unavoidable aspect of how Zen Cart must work when no cookie has been supplied (i.e. a fresh visit to the site). Override is not needed for versions of Zen Cart before 1.3.9 as those versions set the session cookie relative to the site's root.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] The words &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;an&rdquo; are no longer part of the default list of words to be removed from a URI when auto-generation is taking place.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] zen_href_link() modifications for Ceon URI Mapping updated to use new class instead of procedural code. Number of modifications to html_output.php has been reduced from 4 to 1, making this core file's modification easier to make.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Ceon URI Mapping will no longer attempt to redirect from a static URI when the static URI is a historical URI, or the language is being changed, and a form is being POSTed. Nor will it attempt to redirect if it detects a form being POSTed to a dynamic URI that has a current URI mapping, as could happen if the form didn't include the &ldquo;action&rdquo; parameter that was previously being checked against. Avoids problems with modules that don't use zen_href_link() properly.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Core admin file modifications changed to simply instantiate classes and call methods. This is a great improvement as it means that the Ceon URI Mapping code blocks in the modified core files are much simpler, each change now being just a few commands surrounded by the marker comments. This should make the core file modifications much easier to make. Also, since the actual code has been abstracted to classes, it will be much easier to update the software as the core files themselves probably won't need to be changed, the class files can simply be overwritten instead.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Ceon URI Mapping admin functionality is no longer loaded for all Zen Cart admin pages. The files containing the classes are loaded only when needed, as opposed to the previous method of having the functions loaded for every Zen Cart admin page. Avoids needlessly using system resources in sections of the admin that don't use the Ceon URI Mapping functionality.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Auto-upgrade functionality now checks if the current database user has the necessary ALTER TABLE privileges.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Code to remove duplicate mappings updated to match against the base product URI, rather than building a unique URI to check against, for each of the 4 product-related page types, and one to check against product URIs with a trailing slash. Reduces the number of queries for this functionality from 6 to 2. Remaining two queries have also been cut down in scope, increasing their efficiency.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Some admin functionality changed from using the Ceon String class to standard PHP functions as the specific functionality is only ever going to handle ASCII strings, which the PHP functions can handle more quickly/efficiently.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[BUGFIX] 303 and 307 redirects were using the wrong redirection code (both were using 302).</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[BUGFIX] Plus (+) symbols weren't being escaped in the regular expressions which handle the list of words to be removed from auto-generated URIs. Using a plus symbol therefore broke these expressions, meaning that the Remove Words functionality didn't work as expected.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[BUGFIX] The list of words to be removed from auto-generated URIs wasn't being encoded properly for being output on the configuration page, breaking the encoding of certain characters.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[BUGFIX] The URIs being auto-generated for &ldquo;pages related to a product&rdquo; only ever used the defines for the language being used in the admin, even if the store had multiple languages. This meant that, for languages other than the one being used in the admin, the product part of the URI would be in the correct language but the URI part for the related page would be in the wrong language!</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[BUGFIX] Ceon URI Mapping broke the Zen Cart functionality to automatically change the currency to the language's default currency whenever the language was changed. A new override file has been added for init_currencies so that the default language currency functionality works perfectly with static URIs.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] New FAQs added to describe what to do whenever the use of the module causes images not to load, layout issues to occur (e.g. because of unloaded CSS files) or other Zen Cart modules (including those with AJAX functionality (e.g. JavaScript menus)) to stop working.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] New FAQ added about how to deal with 404 errors being displayed.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] New FAQ added about problems with particular file types being &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; whenever the rewrite rule is added.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Information added to the documentation on how to configure the Google Sitemap (XML) module to work properly with Ceon URI Mapping.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[REMOVED] Documentation and FAQ about excluded files functionality removed as the functionality is no longer necessary!</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry RevisionHistoryLastEntry">[BUGFIX] Documentation updated so that the dynamic functionality works when the documentation is being accessed from a local disk using Google Chrome.</p>

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Modified template files added to distribution to enable support for static URIs in the Manufacturers sidebox, the Music Genres sidebox, the Record Company sidebox and all of the product listing filter forms.

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Automatic redirection of variants of index page URIs added (index.php, index.php?main_page=index). Instead of having a default URI mapping for the index page, all links to the index page are now handled in code, with all links automatically being redirected to the root of the store (i.e. the value of DIR_WS_CATALOG, e.g. / or /shop).</p>

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Support added for building canonical URIs for pages which are loaded by posting a HTML form which uses the GET method. Filters on product listing pages etc. use a form to build their URIs; previously this would result in each filter creating a new URI without a canonical hint tag.

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Canonical URI support added! Any page with a static URI will now have a canonical URI tag added to the page's header. This will minimise &ldquo;duplicate content&rdquo; reports as it tells the search engines that multiple pages should be treated as one, without actually redirecting the visitor.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">The canonical URI hint causes any parameters added to the URI to be ignored, thereby preventing duplicate content reports when Zen Cart adds its session ID (?zenid=xxx) to the URI or when paged, sorted or filtered results listings add their parameters (e.g. if a page had a ?sort=2a parameter) etc.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] Module now tracks whether or not the user has just selected a different language. If so, then instead of simply appending &ldquo;&amp;language&rdquo; to the end of the URI, the module will automatically redirect to the specific URI mapping for the page for the newly selected language.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[ADDED] If the URI uses a different language from the session, the session is switched to use the new language. This means that the page will display in the language that the URI is specifically defined for. I.e. if a site has a page in two different languages and each has a translated URI (E.g. /chairs and /chaises), the session language will correctly reflect the URI being displayed in the address bar. This greatly enhances the language handling of Zen Cart!</p>

			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[UPDATED] Dynamic query string variable is no longer appended to static URI links for subcategories or links to product info pages (for those which aren't a link to a linked product). Results in cleaner, &ldquo;nicer&rdquo; URIs!</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry">[BUGFIX] Missing filename definitions added for several product types. Links to products of these types now correctly use any static URI defined for the product.</p>
			<p class="RevisionHistoryEntry RevisionHistoryLastEntry">[UPDATED] Documentation updated with information about new functionality and the methodology behind the new way the module works.</p>
